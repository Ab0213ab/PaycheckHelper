## Application Description

This is a small, but growing personal project software application. Paycheck Helper was designed to help Flight Attendants calculate their notoriously complicated paychecks each month. The application provides fields for user input based on pay period data and run calculations to determine an estimated paycheck amount. Each paycheck amount is logged in a .txt file on the user's machine via XML Serialization to assist with tracking accuracy, budgeting needs, etc. The paycheck amount is then deserialized and displayed to the user. The application also allows for stored user settings which can be changed by the user based on pay increases, tax changes, etc. All field data is checked and exceptions are handled. Planned future features for this application include an interface for reading previously logged paychecks, GUI improvements, and perhaps database connectivity.
